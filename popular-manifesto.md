The Immortality Manifesto
-------------------

# They Stole Our Future!

Wake up, fellow! Our dreams have been crushed by the greedy elite!

Remember the golden days of our grandgrandparents?  They could travel
the world without passports, build a better life for their families,
and flying freely.  But the powerful few couldn't stand to see us
prosper.

They started the Great War in 1914, then plunged us into World War
II. Why? To feed their insatiable hunger for power and wealth! These
wars cost us TRILLIONS - money that could have made our lives better!

But they weren't done robbing us. They killed off independent thinkers
and handed all the power to big corporations.  When we dared to dream
of space, they slammed the door in our faces.

The internet gave us hope again.  We imagined a world where diseases
could be cured with tiny robots, where we could build anything we
wanted atom by atom. But what did they do?  They crushed our dreams
AGAIN!

Instead of letting us reach our full potential, they forced scientists
to work on boring, useless projects. They're afraid of what we might
achieve if we worked together!

Don't let them steal our future any longer! It's time to take back
what's rightfully ours!

# The Big Guys Are Holding Us Back!

The fat cats at the top are continuing to steal our dreams and
crushing our ideas. They don't want us to succeed – they want to keep
all the power and money for themselves!

Think about it:
- Big shots in universities, companies, and government hoard all the
  good stuff
- They shut out anyone with fresh ideas, especially if you're not part
  of their club
- They build walls to keep us from working together and sharing
  knowledge

It's a rigged game! And it gets worse:
- They waste our money on slow, boring projects that go nowhere
- They only care about quick cash, not building a better future for
  all of us
- They punish anyone who dares to try something new and exciting

Remember: The big guys are scared of change.  They'd rather keep
things the same, even if it means we all suffer.  Even if it means we
all gonna die.

Don't let them win!  It's time to tear down their walls and build a
world where everyone's ideas matter.  Spread the word – together, we
can break free from their control!
